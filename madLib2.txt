Let's get down to *0  
To defeat the *1 (s)
Did they send me *2 (s)  when I asked for sons?
You're the *3 (est) bunch I ever met
But you can *4  before we're through
*5 , I'll make a man out of you
Be a *6 
We must be *7  as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a *8  typhoon
*9  a man
With all the strength of a raging *10 
Mysterious as the dark side of the *11
