The snow *0  white on the mountain tonight 
Not a *1  to be seen 
A kingdom of isolation, 
And it looks like I'm the *2 . 
The wind is *3  like this swirling storm inside 
Couldn't *4  it in, *5  knows I've tried 
Don't let *6  in, don't let them see 
Be the *7  girl you always have to be 
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know 
Well, now they *8  
Let it *9 , let it go
Can't hold it *10  anymore 
Let it go, let it go 
Turn away and slam the *11
