I wanna *0 where the *1 (s) are
I wanna see, wanna see *2 dancing

Walking around on those *3 (s)
What do you *4 'em? Oh, *5 (s)

Flipping your fins *6 don't get too far
Legs are *7 for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a 
What's that word again? Street
*8 where they walk, up where they *9
Up where they *10 all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be, *11 of that world
